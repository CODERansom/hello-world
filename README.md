Existential, no Crisis
======================
Today a young man on acid realized that all matter was merely energy condensed into a slow vibration,
that we are all of one conciousness, in sharing witrh itself subjectively,
that there is no such thing as death, that life is merely a dream,
and we're the imagination of ourselves...
